"""A read-only corpus: the files an agent may grep and read, addressed by section.

The unit is a :class:`SourceFile` -- one *whole* file, plus an index of the sections it
was split into. Keeping the file whole is what makes a citation work: line numbers are
absolute within the file, so the ``path:line`` a grep hit reports and the ``path:line``
a read shows are the same numbers. The sections are an index *over* that file, which is
what lets ``read`` fetch one subsection instead of four hundred lines, and lets ``grep``
say which section a hit landed in.

Finding the section heads is the task's business, not the corpus's: a statute opens its
provisions with ``(c)(1)``, a manual with markdown headings, a codebase with ``def``.
So a corpus takes sections already computed -- or a ``sectioner`` callable -- and never
guesses at structure itself.

A :class:`Corpus` is deliberately *not* a
:class:`~step_controller.harness.workspace.base.Workspace`. The corpus is task evidence,
identical across branches and read-only; the workspace is per-rollout scratch the model
reaches through ``workspace.tools()``. Putting evidence in the workspace would fork-copy
it per branch and confuse "what I was given" with "what I wrote down".
