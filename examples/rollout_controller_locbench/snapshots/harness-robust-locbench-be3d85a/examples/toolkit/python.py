"""``python``: run a calculation in a subprocess that cannot outlive its limits.

The point is arithmetic, not general execution. An LLM's silent slips live in bracket
tables, per-item fees and date differences, so an env that wants those right gives the
model somewhere to compute them; everything here exists to make that cheap to offer and
hard to abuse.

The screen is deliberately an allow/deny pass over the AST rather than an interpreter:
functions, loops, comprehensions and f-strings all stay available, because real
iteration is exactly what the arithmetic needs. What it blocks is anything that would
reach *outside* the process -- which, in an eval harness, is usually the metric rather
than the security posture: the answer keys tend to sit on the same filesystem, and a
model that reads one has not solved anything.

The runtime side is belt and braces: ``-I -S`` (no site, no user paths, no
``PYTHONPATH`` or ``$CWD`` on ``sys.path``), a scrubbed environment, CPU / address
space / file size / process rlimits the child sets on itself before running a byte of
agent code, and a wall-clock timeout that kills the process. It is not a container and
does not pretend to be one.
