"""Toolkit: reusable, task-agnostic tools an env can hand its agent.

This is an example extension, not part of the installed ``step_controller`` package.
:mod:`step_controller.harness.tools` says what a tool *is* (the protocol, the schema,
``dispatch``). This package is the other half: concrete tools that recur across tasks,
so an env author writes the task and not a fourth ``grep``.

Two pieces, and they compose:

* a :class:`Corpus` of :class:`SourceFile` -- read-only evidence, addressed by path and
  by :class:`Section` -- with :class:`ListTool`, :class:`GrepTool` and :class:`ReadTool`
  over it, which are respectively how an agent discovers, finds and reads it;
* :class:`PythonTool`, a sandboxed subprocess for the arithmetic a model should not do
  in its head.

Everything task-specific is a constructor argument. Finding the section heads is the
env's job (a statute opens provisions with ``(c)(1)``, a manual with ``##``), and so is
the prose: each tool's ``description`` is rendered into every prompt, and it is the only
place the *strategy* for using it can be taught, so an env with a subject of its own
should pass its own.

Building an env's tool list, then, is composition rather than subclassing::

    corpus = Corpus(tuple(SourceFile.sectioned(p, t, my_heads) for p, t in files))
    tools = [
        *workspace.tools(),                       # durable notes, if any
        ListTool(corpus, section_arg="provision"),
        GrepTool(corpus, description=MY_GREP),
        ReadTool(corpus, section_arg="provision"),
        PythonTool(timeout=10.0),
    ]

Tools are constructed, not registry-built: nothing in the package builds a tool from a
config name (unlike ``Workspace`` or ``Compactor``), because a tool needs the task's own
corpus and prose, which no name can carry. If that ever changes, the slot goes in
:mod:`step_controller.harness.tools`, next to the protocol.

The modules' ``DEFAULT_DESCRIPTION`` constants are deliberately not re-exported here --
they share a name; import them from :mod:`~.grep` / :mod:`~.list` / :mod:`~.read` when
extending one.
