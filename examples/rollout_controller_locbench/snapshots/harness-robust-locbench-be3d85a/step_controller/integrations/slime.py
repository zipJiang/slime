"""Running the step controller as a slime rollout function.

slime trains with many Ray actors, each calling a rollout function against a shared
inference server, and it hands each actor its endpoint **at runtime**. So a live
generator cannot be baked into an authored config; it has to be built inside the actor.
Hence two layers:

* :class:`~step_controller.config.RolloutSpec` -- picklable configuration only. Ships
  to every actor. Vendor-neutral, so it lives in ``step_controller.config`` and is
  re-exported here for the imports that name it through this module.
* :class:`~step_controller.loop.Runtime` -- the live bundle, built once per actor
  from the actor's own generator and tokenizer, carrying the spec's config.

Flattening a result into trainer samples is *not* one of those layers. slime consumes
the same span-per-sample shape any trainer would -- one sample per packed span, the head
it trains and the estimator that scored it named in its metadata -- so
:func:`~step_controller.export.to_samples` lives beside the records it flattens and is
re-exported here for the imports that already name it through this module.

    """Build the coroutine slime's ``--custom-generate-function-path`` expects.

    ``min_abs_advantage`` is forwarded to :func:`to_samples` after preparation;
    it filters actor edges without changing search or critic targets.

    **The precedence rule, whole:** the runtime a factory returns keeps its live objects
    and gets ``spec.config`` -- the authored configuration replaces whatever the factory
    left there. One assignment, because the configuration is one record: an actor-local
    override would make two actors run different knobs while both claimed the same spec.

    ``to_prompt`` says how to get the prompt out of the trainer's own sample type, and
    defaults to the identity because a caller whose ``sample`` *is* the prompt string
    should not have to say so. slime's ``Sample`` is an object, so a slime actor passes
    ``to_prompt=lambda sample: sample.prompt``; leaving it unset there hands the object
    itself to :func:`~step_controller.loop.run_search`, which refuses it by type.

    ``workspace_factory`` is the same question for the *workspace*, and it is a
    per-prompt one: a workspace is a rollout's own scratch -- notes a ``storage`` call
    writes, forked per branch -- so an env whose tools came from ``workspace.tools()``
    needs one built per sample and threaded into
    :func:`~step_controller.loop.run_search`. Left unset, a rollout gets a
    :class:`~step_controller.harness.workspace.NullWorkspace`, which is right for an
    env with no workspace tools and wrong for one that has them -- silently wrong, in a
    tool-result string the model reads, so
    :meth:`~step_controller.harness.runner.Runner.root` refuses that pairing outright.
    It takes the trainer's own sample, as ``to_prompt`` does, so a workspace can be
    seeded from the case it belongs to. It is not a spec
    field for the same reason a runner is not: the *factory* is authored where the env
    is built, and the workspace it returns holds live per-prompt state that no picklable
    record may carry. And it is not built once per actor: one workspace shared across
    prompts would carry one prompt's notes into the next and race between the concurrent
    rollouts of a single actor.

    ``runtime_factory`` owns everything that needs the actor's live endpoint, and the
    anchor scorer is one of those things. A ``mixture`` proposal on the config buys
    coverage and owes an importance ratio on its explore draws, which needs the anchor
    policy's logprobs over tokens it did not generate -- so a factory configuring one
    must also set :attr:`~step_controller.loop.Runtime.scorer`, e.g.
    ``TokenScorer(anchor_policy)``, or the run fails with a clear ``ValueError``
    before export. Not a config field, because a scorer holds a live policy, which is
    exactly what a picklable spec may not carry.

    :attr:`~step_controller.loop.Runtime.value_model` -- the value head's reward model
    -- belongs to the factory and supplies the network prior for refined TD.
    There is no version to
    keep in step with it: ``run_search`` files its estimates under the config's
    ``reward_config.value_version`` itself. Its bound belongs to the factory too --
    :attr:`~step_controller.loop.Runtime.score_timeout`, how long *that* server may take
    before a batch is abandoned as a scoring failure, set beside
    ``Runner(generate_timeout=...)`` for the same reason: a deadline is a fact about an
    endpoint, and a spec travels to actors that may not share one. A pass drains its
    in-flight expansions rather than cancelling them, so an unbounded backend of either
    kind holds the training step, not just its own rollout.
