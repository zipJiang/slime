"""How wrong the critic is at a node, and how noisy one more draw there would be.

:class:`~step_controller.allocation.refinement.ResidualWorth` needs exactly two numbers
per node -- the posterior mean of the squared calibration error :math:`E[(V - V^*)^2
\\mid \\text{data}]`, and the variance of one more sampled return -- and nothing else
about the tree. Both are statements about a *distribution over outcomes*, and which
distribution that is is a fact about the task rather than a tuning: a {0,1} verifier
outcome and a real-valued score are different models, not different constants in one. So
the answer comes from a registrable slot, and the allocation score is the same function
of it either way.

Nothing here reads the view or the node. A posterior is a function of ``(value, stats,
kappa)`` alone, which is what lets every claim below be checked against a hand
computation instead of against a tree -- and what lets a project with its own outcome
family register a third model without touching the allocator.

    back on where the ledger is empty. That is deliberate. The alternative -- an
    uninformative prior -- would make every unmeasured node report the same maximal
    error and the allocator would rank them by nothing at all.

    Two numbers rather than a whole distribution, because the score

    twice therefore cannot report itself as certain, which is precisely the degeneracy
