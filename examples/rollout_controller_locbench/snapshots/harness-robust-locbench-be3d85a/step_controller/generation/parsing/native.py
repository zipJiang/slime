"""The third protocol: tool calls a backend hands back as *structure*, not as text.

:mod:`~step_controller.generation.parsing.hermes` and
:mod:`~step_controller.generation.parsing.qwen_xml` read
a dialect the model wrote into its completion. A hosted chat model does neither: given
real ``tools``, it returns ``message.tool_calls`` -- a field beside the completion, in
the API's own shape -- and its completion text contains no call at all. Asking such a
model for someone else's in-band dialect is what produced the nameless, malformed calls
the OpenAI-bridge experiments measured; asking it for its own produces named calls with
typed arguments, and this parser is the one that reads them.

The price is exactness, and it is why :attr:`NativeToolCallParser.trainable` is
``False``: the call never was tokens, so a training pass over this turn's ids would be a
pass over the prose around an action it cannot see. A rollout under this parser is
evaluation -- :func:`~step_controller.loop.run_search` refuses a training-configured
tree on a policy carrying it, by design.
