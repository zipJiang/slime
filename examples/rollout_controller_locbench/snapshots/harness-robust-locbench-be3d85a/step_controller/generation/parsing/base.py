"""The action parser: turn a model generation into a decoded action (text -> action).

Because the :class:`Env` is pure world dynamics that consumes an *already-decoded*
action, the text->action step lives outside the env, here. An :class:`ActionParser` is
the task's decoder; the action type ``A`` it produces is the same ``A`` the env's
``step`` consumes -- the one shared contract between the two halves.

It is handed the whole :class:`GenerateResult` (not just the text) so it can consult
``matched_stop`` / ``stop_reason`` -- e.g. treat an illegal stop-string hit as a
malformed action -- not only ``text``.

:func:`tool_turn` is the part every *tool-calling* dialect shares: split the reasoning
off, find the ``<tool_call>`` blocks, strip them out of the visible text. Only what is
inside a block differs between dialects (Hermes' JSON body, Qwen3.5's ``<function=...>``
XML), so a dialect module is its per-block decoder and nothing else -- see
:mod:`step_controller.generation.parsing.hermes` and
:mod:`step_controller.generation.parsing.qwen_xml`.
:data:`TOOL_CALL`, the outer tag they share, is therefore defined here rather than
beside a caller.
