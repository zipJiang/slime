"""Per-node branching control: how many workers may branch from a node right now.

A :class:`Gate` is attached to each node and answers "is a branch slot free?" plus
reserve/release around an expansion -- a non-blocking, semaphore-style counter. A
:class:`GatingPolicy` mints the gate for each new node, so the cap can vary per node
(by depth, payload, etc.); :class:`WidthGating` is the flat one cap for every node.

The policy is the seam; the gate is not. Both shipped policies mint the *same* counter
with different numbers, so ``Gate`` is that counter rather than an interface with one
implementation hidden behind it -- a policy wanting different bookkeeping subclasses it.
