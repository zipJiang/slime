"""The scheduler: a bounded-parallel loop that grows a search tree, pure over the tree.

One scheduling step selects a forkable node, asks the injected :class:`Expander` for its
children (``expand(payload) -> (payloads, metadata)``), attaches those to the tree, and
lets a :class:`AllocationSession` update bookkeeping -- then selects again, until a
:class:`Termination` says stop. Up to ``max_concurrency`` expansions run at once via
slot-filling (``asyncio.wait(FIRST_COMPLETED)``): as each finishes it is integrated and
a freed slot is refilled. An expansion that raises is recorded as a failure, never
sinking the run.

**Termination drains, it does not abort.** When ``remaining()`` reaches 0 the loop stops
*launching* and then awaits what is already in flight, integrating each result the
ordinary way -- nodes attached, turns charged, backup run. The alternative (cancelling
them) threw away up to ``max_concurrency`` rollouts' worth of finished LLM calls every
time a pass hit its budget, which for a training harness is the most expensive compute
in the system discarded at the exact moment the budget said it had been paid for. The
price is a bounded overshoot: a turn/node budget is a stop condition, not a launch
count, so totals may exceed it by at most one episode per slot -- the same bound the
check-before-launch already carried, now realized in the tree instead of thrown away.
:class:`~step_controller.scheduler.core.policies.Budget` states the size of it, and the
one configuration where it is not a bound at all. A *rollout* budget stays a hard cap:
in-flight expansions are charged against it before launch. Draining also makes the
per-call bounds load-bearing (``Runner.generate_timeout``, ``NodeScorer(timeout=...)``):
a pass ends no sooner than its slowest in-flight expansion.

Cancellation is the one thing that is *not* a failure. ``CancelledError`` is a
``BaseException``, so it passes straight through the ``except Exception`` that records a
dead expansion: cancelling the task that runs the loop stops the search and propagates,
rather than being logged as one more dead rollout and re-selected. That is the one path
that still aborts: in-flight expansions are cancelled and the gate slots and backup
reservations they hold are handed back (see :meth:`Scheduler._abort`).

The scheduler holds only the injected ``expander`` and the pure tree policies
(selection, termination, backup); it never touches a ``Runner``, generation, or how a
payload is made. All mutable search state lives in the :class:`SchedulerState` per run,
and every tree access runs under ``state.lock`` -- so external code can inspect or
mutate the tree mid-run by holding the same lock (``async with state.lock:``).

**Scoring.** With a :class:`~step_controller.scheduler.core.critic.NodeScorer`
registered, one expansion is *expand then score*: children come back already scored, so
a node's critic value is on it before selection can ever see it on the frontier. That
ordering is the point -- a value-guided selection needs it, and a separate scoring loop
cannot give it, since it races the selection that reads it. Scores go to
``node.critic[version]``; ``node.mean_return`` remains the :class:`AllocationSession`'s,
fed by
the realized return alone. To score an *existing* tree instead (post-hoc, a second
model, another version), run a
:class:`~step_controller.scheduler.core.critic.CriticScheduler` over the same state.
