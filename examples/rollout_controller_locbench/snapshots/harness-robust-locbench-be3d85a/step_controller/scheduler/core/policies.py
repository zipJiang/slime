        ``0`` ends the *launching*, not the run: the scheduler then drains what is
        already in flight and integrates it normally (finished rollouts are the
        expensive half, and cancelling them at the budget threw away up to one episode
        per slot). The first ``0`` is latched -- this is never asked again on that run,
        so a predicate a drained result would flip back cannot re-open the pass -- and
        the stats a caller reads afterwards include everything the drain integrated.

    """Stop on a spent budget (turns / rollout count / tree size), or on a goal.

    ``goal`` is an optional predicate over the read-only view (e.g. "a terminal with
    reward >= 1 exists"); when it returns ``True`` the loop ends early.

    ``max_rollouts`` bounds *attempts*: completed expansions plus failed ones.

    ``max_turns`` bounds realized env transitions -- the unit compute is actually spent
    in, and the only one that means the same thing whether an expansion rolled one
    region or a whole episode. It is a stop condition rather than a launch count,
    because what the *next* expansion will cost is not known before it runs. Total turns
    are therefore bounded by ``max_turns + max_concurrency * Runner.max_steps``: the
    check happens before launching, and expansions already in flight are drained rather
    than cancelled -- they finish and are counted, since a finished rollout thrown away
    at the budget line is the most expensive thing this loop could discard.
    ``max_nodes`` has the same overshoot, for the same reason. Only ``max_rollouts``
    is exact, because a rollout can be counted before it runs.

    That bound assumes the runner *has* a step budget. Under ``Runner.max_steps = -1``
    one expansion is unlimited, so a turn or node budget still stops the loop
    *launching* but bounds nothing: an env that never ends the episode makes the pass as
    long as its slowest in-flight expansion, which is then bounded only by
    ``Runner.generate_timeout``. A run that wants a guaranteed ceiling needs a
    ``max_rollouts`` (exact whatever the runner does) or a finite ``max_steps``.

    The overshoot is *carried*, not compounded: the next pass's cap is computed from
    what the tree has already spent (:func:`~step_controller.loop._budget`), so a pass
    that ran 3 turns over hands the next one a baseline 3 higher and still gets its own
    full share -- the overshoot is paid once, by the whole run's total, never by the
    following pass's evidence.
