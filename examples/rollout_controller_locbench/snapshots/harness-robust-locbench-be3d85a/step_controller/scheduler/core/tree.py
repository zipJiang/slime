"""The scheduler's owned state: a tree of node payloads plus a selectable frontier.

The tree is generic over an opaque payload ``P`` -- the scheduler is pure over the
tree/state and never touches how a payload is made. All it needs from a payload is the
small :class:`Payload` protocol (``forkable`` / ``done`` / ``reward``), which
:class:`~step_controller.harness.RolloutState` satisfies structurally, so a rollout
checkpoint drops in as the payload and a later caller can use a different one.

Every payload the scheduler produces is stored as a :class:`Node` in an explicit tree
(parent -> children); the subset that may be expanded -- ``forkable``, not terminal, and
with a free slot in its gate -- is tracked in :attr:`SchedulerState.frontier`, which a
:class:`AllocationSession` reads to pick what to expand next.
