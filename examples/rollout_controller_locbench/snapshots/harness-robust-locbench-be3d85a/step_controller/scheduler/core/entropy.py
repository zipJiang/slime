"""Branch where the model was least certain: windowed token-entropy node selection.

A verifier-free selection criterion, ported from the pre-rewrite traversal engine
(``windowed_token_entropy`` there). It ranks a frontier node by how uncertain the model
was while generating that node's *children*, so the search spends its budget where the
policy's own distribution says the outcome is still open -- no reward model, no ground
truth, nothing but the logprobs generation already returned.

The per-token value is ARES-style ``p * -log p`` over the **sampled** token only. It is
not the entropy of the distribution (which would need the full logits): it peaks at
``p = 1/e`` and falls to zero at *both* ends, so a token the model was certain of and a
token it got badly wrong both score low. That is the quantity the original experiments
measured, kept as-is rather than "improved" into something unmeasured.

Windowing is what the results turned on: a single uncertain token is noise, so the score
is the highest *sliding-window mean* over the region, which localizes the most uncertain
span instead of averaging it away across a long generation.

What counts as an edge -- and getting only the *new* tokens out of a checkpoint that
carries the whole rollout -- belongs to the harness
(:meth:`~step_controller.harness.rollout.RolloutState.generated_since`); this module is
the windowing and the aggregation, which is the part that is a scheduler policy. That
edge is every generated token of every turn on it, in generation order, so turn
boundaries are invisible to the window and a window may straddle two turns.
