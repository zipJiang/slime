    Exactly 1 for an edge drawn from the anchor -- the whole v1 configuration. That is
    read off the edge's own provenance rather than off the channel names, because the
    configuration that needs no correction is also the one that never fills the anchor
    channel: deciding by name would demand logprobs that by design do not exist.

    Neither the behavior channel nor the clip has a default: both are properties of the
    run this edge came out of (the policy's ``version``, the batch's
    ``reward_config.clip``), and a default here is a second answer to a question the
    caller already has the answer to -- which is how a ratio comes to be computed
    against a channel nobody wrote, or capped at a bound nobody authored.

    The clip is applied **in log space**, before the exponential rather than after it.
    ``math.exp`` raises ``OverflowError`` above ~709 nats, and these are *sequence*
    log-ratios: a few hundredths of a nat per token over a four-thousand-token edge
    clears that comfortably. Clipping the result would therefore be the one thing that
    never ran on the edges the clip exists for -- the whole export dying with ``math
    range error`` on exactly the heavy tail it was written to survive.
