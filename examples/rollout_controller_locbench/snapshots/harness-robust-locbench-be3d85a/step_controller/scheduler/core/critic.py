"""A critic scheduler: annotate tree nodes with version-tagged critic values.

Runs *concurrently* with the generation
:class:`~step_controller.scheduler.core.scheduler.Scheduler` over the same
:class:`SchedulerState`. Where generation grows the tree, the critic reads it: it
selects nodes, scores each node's serialized payload with a
:class:`~step_controller.reward.RewardModel`, and writes the scalar back as
``node.critic[version]`` -- keyed by the reward-model version so several
passes/models coexist.

Both schedulers share one ``state`` and mutate it under ``state.lock`` (the lock the
tree exposes for exactly this). The critic *tracks* generation via an ``until``
event: it keeps scoring new nodes as they appear, then drains and stops once
generation is done.

    The three things that always travel together when anything scores a node, in one
    object so both callers share them: the :class:`CriticScheduler` below (scoring an
    existing tree, after the fact) and the
    :class:`~step_controller.scheduler.core.scheduler.Scheduler` itself (scoring what an
    expansion just produced, before the node reaches the frontier).

    Scores land in ``node.critic[version]`` and *only* there -- never in
    ``node.mean_return``, which is backup bookkeeping over the realized return. Keeping
    the learned estimate and the observed return in separate fields is what makes one
    auditable against the other; a scorer that folded into ``mean_return`` would launder
    them together.

    ``serialize`` is optional and defaults to :func:`rollout_text`: rollout payloads are
    the only ones in production, so a value head is ``NodeScorer(model=rm,
    version=cfg.value_version)`` and nothing more. Pass one for any other payload type.

    ``timeout`` bounds the reward-model call in seconds (``None``, the default, waits as
    long as the backend does). It is the scoring half of what
    ``Runner.generate_timeout`` is for generation, and for the same reason: nothing else
    bounds one HTTP call, a scheduler stops on a *budget*, and a reward server that
    never answers spends none of it -- so one swallowed request stalls the expansion,
    the prompt, and the training step behind it. When it fires the batch is a scoring
    failure on the ordinary terms (counted in ``stats[score_failures]``, the rollout
    kept and only the estimate missing), because a timeout reaches both callers through
    the same ``except`` a 503 does.
