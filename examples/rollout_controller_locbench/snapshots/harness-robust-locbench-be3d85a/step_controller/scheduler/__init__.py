"""Scheduler: drive many rollouts as a parallel tree search, pure over the tree.

A layer above the harness. The harness runs *one* rollout; the :class:`Scheduler`
orchestrates *many*: select a forkable node, ask an injected :class:`Expander` for its
children, attach them to a tree, and select again -- in bounded parallel, until a budget
or goal is met.

One package, :mod:`~step_controller.scheduler.core`: the live loop (tree, gating,
policies, expansion, orchestration, optional entropy/critic scoring) together with the
tree statistics a return is read off (:mod:`~step_controller.scheduler.core.returns` --
advantage, its baseline, its importance correction, and which paths ended).

The scheduler imports neither allocation nor preparation contracts. Allocation
builds scheduler policies; preparation reads settled tree views. Shared return
mathematics lives in core, while search objectives live in step_controller.allocation.
