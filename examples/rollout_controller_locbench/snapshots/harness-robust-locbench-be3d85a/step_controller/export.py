    The five keywords named here are the actor contract. ``**extra`` carries
    the actor's own keys

    keys (``node_id``, ``edge_tokens``, ``span_index``, ``span_count``,
    ``group_edge_count``), which arrive by
    name on every call and may be ignored. A factory *must* take ``**extra``, because
    this module adds a key when the export learns to say something new and a factory
    that enumerated them would break on the next one.

    Generic in what it returns, so ``to_samples(result, i, sample_factory=MySample)``
    is a ``list[MySample]`` rather than a ``list[Any]`` a trainer then has to cast.

    ``span`` is the packed region itself, and ``logprobs`` is the behavior column
    already selected out of it (:attr:`PreparedBatch.behavior_version`) -- a factory
    never has to know which channel a run generated under, and one that wants another
    (the anchor, say) can still read ``span.logprobs`` for it.

    ``metadata["diagnostics"]``, where no trainer can mistake it for a coefficient.

    ``sample_factory`` builds the trainer's own sample type instead of a dict -- see

    ``min_abs_advantage`` excludes whole actor edges whose absolute estimator weight
    is at most the cutoff, before importance correction. ``None`` disables filtering;
    zero excludes exactly zero weights. Edges containing malformed compaction
    attempts are retained to preserve their small shaping signal.
    Critic records and the prepared batch remain
    intact, including when every actor edge is excluded. The caller must support that
    empty actor group; this function does not retain a below-threshold fallback edge.

    Every actor sample carries ``group_edge_count``, the original number of actor
    edges in this prompt. A trainer averaging tokens within edges and edges within
    prompts must use that count, rather than recounting the surviving edges, to keep
    retained coefficients unchanged. Excluding samples also excludes any auxiliary
