"""A chat tokenizer for the hosted models, over ``tiktoken`` and nothing else.

:class:`~step_controller.codec.ChatCodec` wraps anything satisfying the
:class:`~step_controller.codec.HFTokenizer` protocol, and until now the only thing that
did was a real HuggingFace tokenizer -- which meant a hosted-model run had to borrow
some open model's chat template to count its tokens and render its transcript. That
pairing works, but it lies twice: the counts a fold triggers on are another vocabulary's
counts, and the transcript is rendered in a dialect the hosted model was never trained
to read.

:class:`TiktokenChatTokenizer` is the honest pairing. It satisfies that same protocol
with the hosted model's *own* encoding (``o200k_base`` for the current line), so token
counts -- the numbers that decide when a context folds and whether a budget is spent --
are the ones the server will also arrive at. Its template is deliberately ours and
deliberately plain: on this path the prompt reaches the model as a *decoded* user turn
(see
:class:`~step_controller.generation._openai_shared.NativePolicy`) and the tool
schemas reach it as the API's own ``tools``, so the template's only job is to render a
conversation a reader -- and a model reading it as prose -- can follow unambiguously.

``tiktoken`` is lazily imported, like the ``openai`` SDK is: it ships in the
``openai-chat`` extra, and everything else in this package must import without it.
