    A ``builds_self`` registry namespace, so a loaded YAML mapping becomes this record

    block) into the object the field is typed for, rather than leaving a ``dict`` that
    would look configured and behave defaulted.

    Keyword-only, like every self-building config record here: the fields are knobs in
    no meaningful order, and the authored form is a mapping anyway. So there is no
    positional call to keep working -- and none to silently re-bind when a knob is
    added or two are reordered.
