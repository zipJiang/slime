    Welford rather than a list: an allocator asks for the mean and the spread, never for

    budget for no reader.

    :attr:`n` is deliberately its own count rather than reusing ``m_done``, and neither
    bounds the other: they are two ledgers about one node. ``m_done`` counts *purchases*
    -- rollouts this allocator paid for and must settle -- while :attr:`n` counts
    *evidence*, every valid policy suffix observed at this checkpoint.
    A purchase that came back unfinished settles without contributing a return (its
    suffix would be shaping-only), which puts ``m_done`` ahead; a node an earlier pass
    created contributes the return of the rollout that created it without anyone having
    bought it (:func:`~step_controller.allocation.evidence.RolloutLedger.record`),
    which puts :attr:`n` ahead.
