    """How raw rewards become one training number -- frozen for a whole batch.

    The envs store ``reward_outcome`` and ``reward_step`` unmixed and the critic writes
    its estimates under a version key, so every downstream statistic has to say which
    weighting and which value channel it used. This record *is* that statement: it is
    stamped into the provenance of everything derived under it, so two numbers computed
    under different coefficients can never be silently compared. Frozen per allocation
    batch, which is what makes an estimate collected before a decision and one collected
    after it commensurable.

    ``value_version`` and ``anchor_version`` name channels, not values: the critic key
    playing :math:`V_{\\mathrm{base}}` and the logprob key of the anchor policy
    :math:`\\pi_k` (see :func:`trainable_logprobs`).

    A ``builds_self`` registry namespace, so an authored mapping (a YAML file, a
    ``RolloutSpec`` field) is coerced into this frozen record rather than reaching a
    consumer as a dict -- there is nothing here to *choose* between, only fields to
    fill.

    Keyword-only, like every self-building config record here: the fields are a bag of
    independent knobs in no meaningful order, so a positional caller is writing down an
    order that is not part of the design -- and reordering two floats would then change
    what an existing call *means* rather than failing it.
