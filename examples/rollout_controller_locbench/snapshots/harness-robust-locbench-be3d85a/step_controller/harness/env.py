"""The task environment: pure world dynamics an agent acts on, one step at a time.

An :class:`Env` is deliberately **model-free** -- it holds no generator, codec, or
tokenizer. Its one job is :meth:`Env.step`: given a state and an *already-decoded*
action, apply the world dynamics and return a :class:`StepResult`. Generation (render,
generate, then parse into an action) happens outside, in the rollout loop; the parser
that turns a model completion into the action is a separate :class:`ActionParser`.

Keeping the env pure is what makes it unit-testable with no model server, and keeps
generation/seed/policy provenance out of the task code. ``step`` is stateless over the
state passed in (state in, new state out), so steps run concurrently and tree-search
branches stay independent. The one ambient dependency a step may need -- the durable
:class:`Workspace` its tools read/write -- is passed **in** per call, never captured, so
the task state stays pure data and forked branches get isolated workspaces.
