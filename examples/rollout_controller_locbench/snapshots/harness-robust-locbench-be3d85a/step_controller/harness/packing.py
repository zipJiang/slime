"""Regions, derived: pack a run of turns into prefix-stable training sequences.

A *region* is not a stored thing. It is what you get when consecutive
:class:`~step_controller.harness.turn.Turn` s chain -- each turn's ``prefix`` extends
the previous pack's tokens, i.e. the backend's KV cache hit -- and :func:`regions` is
the greedy merge that finds the fewest such chains. Extend the current pack while the
next turn's prefix starts with everything packed so far; otherwise flush and start a new
one.

Two things force a flush:

* a **prefix mismatch** -- the chat template rewrote history behind us (Qwen3+ stripping
  ``<think>`` from earlier assistant turns). That is a cache miss, not an inexact
  region: both packs are exact, and the later one restates the earlier generations as
  its own *masked* prefix, so no token is trainable twice.
* a **tag change** -- a fold's turns never share a pack with task turns, even in the
  freak case where their prefixes happen to chain. A pack is a training sample, and one
  that mixed a summary written under the compactor's instruction with task work would be
  labelled with whichever tag came first.

A turn is *in* a pack whatever it holds. A turn with an empty prefix and an empty
completion -- nothing conditioned on, nothing generated -- still gets a span, and if it
is alone in its pack that pack has no tokens at all. The alternative, dropping such a
turn, would make ``spans`` stop indexing the turn log: :func:`reevaluate` fills a
version through the spans, so a turn no pack mentions is a turn no scorer can ever
reach, and the strict :func:`~step_controller.harness.turn.logprob` then raises over a
log that was fully scored. A zero-token pack costs nothing to carry and nothing reads
it (:func:`~step_controller.export.spans_of` keeps only packs that hold tokens), so the
emptiness stays where it came from instead of turning into a gap.

The runner produces exactly one such turn, and on purpose: the marker a silent fold
leaves (:meth:`~step_controller.harness.runner.Runner._fold`), which is how a fold that
generated nothing is still visible in the log. It packs alone -- its tag flushes the
task turns either side of it -- into a pack with spans and no tokens, and every reader
of a pack is stated over its spans for that reason. Beyond it, this is for a log
assembled by other means: a test, an import, a backend that reported an empty
``prefix_tokens`` against an empty ``cond``.

No render fallback lives here: the runner sends the backend a token list and records
exactly that list as the turn's ``prefix``, so packing never has to guess where a
completion sat inside a re-render.
