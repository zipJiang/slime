"""A turn: one generate as the engine saw it -- the atom of the checkpoint's log.

A checkpoint's log is an append-only tuple of :class:`Turn` s. Each one records the
exact token prefix that was sent to the backend, the completion that came back, the
version-keyed logprobs over that completion, and -- for a task turn -- the env
transition the action produced. Nothing is ever rewritten: a rollout advances by
appending one more turn, so the difference between two checkpoints on one line is a
plain tail slice.

*Regions are derived, not stored.* What multi-turn RL trains on is a masked token string
-- base prefix (masked), generation (trainable), observation (masked), generation... --
and that is exactly what :func:`~step_controller.harness.packing.regions` builds from
a run of turns whose prefixes chain. A chat template that rewrites history (Qwen3+
stripping ``<think>``) breaks the chain and the same run packs into two sequences
instead of one; nothing about the log changes. Because packing is a function of the log,
a region is never a thing that can go stale.

*One marker, and it is the tag.* :attr:`Turn.tag` is ``"task"`` for the work and
``"fold"`` for the turns a context fold generated. A fold is a nested rollout over its
own env (see :mod:`step_controller.harness.compaction.fold_env`), so its turns are
ordinary, trainable turns; the tag is what keeps them tellable apart from task work.
Every fold leaves a run of fold-tagged turns -- a compactor that generated nothing
still appends one zero-token marker turn -- so *everything else about folding is
derived from the tag*: how many times the context was rewritten is the number of
maximal fold runs, and where a branch may restore a context is the turn after one (see
:attr:`~step_controller.harness.rollout.RolloutState.folds` and
:meth:`~step_controller.harness.rollout.RolloutState.boundaries`). A second field
saying either of those things could disagree with the log; a tag cannot disagree with
itself.

``logprobs`` is version-keyed exactly like
:attr:`~step_controller.scheduler.core.tree.Node.critic`: the behavior policy fills its
own key at generation time, and a scorer (:mod:`step_controller.harness.rescoring`)
fills
another policy's key later. Storing them per *turn* rather than per region is what makes
an edge exact -- a token's logprob belongs to the generate that produced it, and no
offset arithmetic is needed to say which tokens a fork added.
