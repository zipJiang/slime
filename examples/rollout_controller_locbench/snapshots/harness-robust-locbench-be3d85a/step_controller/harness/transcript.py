"""Showing a conversation back to a model: ``role: content``, calls flattened.

The rollout's source of truth is a list of **message strings**, and the loop's own
direction of travel is forward -- render them to token ids and generate. This module is
the *other* direction: :func:`format_transcript` renders messages back into flat text
for another model to read (a compactor's fold, a reward model's view of a rollout).

It is deliberately dialect-free -- it matches only the outer ``<tool_call>`` tag, which
every dialect the harness speaks shares -- so nothing that merely wants to *show* a
conversation has to import a parser to do it.
