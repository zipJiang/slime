"""The rollout checkpoint: the append-only turn log and the readers over it.

A :class:`RolloutState` is the whole continuation point of a rollout -- the
conversation, the env state, the workspace, and the log of
:class:`~step_controller.harness.turn.Turn` s taken so far -- and it is also the *final
result* of one, since a finished rollout is just a checkpoint nothing continues from.
The driver that produces it lives next door in
:mod:`step_controller.harness.runner`; this module is the data and the questions you
can ask of it, so a consumer (scheduler, exporter, preparation) can depend on the
checkpoint without dragging in the loop.

**The log is turns; regions are derived.** ``turns`` only ever grows by append, and
:func:`~step_controller.harness.packing.regions` derives the masked training
sequences from it on demand. There is no active region to extend, no record to replace
with a longer copy, and an edge is a plain tail slice -- which is what makes
:meth:`RolloutState.edge` a slice rather than an identity-and-offset walk.

**Forking.** ``messages`` is the source of truth (the token prefix is re-rendered from
it each turn), ``state`` is the env's, and ``workspace`` is durable scratch.
:meth:`RolloutState.fork` copies the workspace and shares the immutable rest, so a
caller can snapshot any turn for inspection and fork roots or folds for best-of-N,
tree search, or what-if continuations. Because the env and its tools take the workspace
as a per-turn argument (never captured), the branches stay isolated.
