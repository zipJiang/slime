"""The workspace: per-rollout scratch the model reaches through tools.

A workspace owns three things:

* **tools** -- :meth:`tools` / :meth:`compaction_tools`: schemas plus the ``call``
  implementations the model may invoke. How a call is executed is the tool's job
  (often closing over, or receiving, this workspace via
  ``dispatch(..., workspace=self)``).
* **guidance** -- :meth:`guidance` / :meth:`folded_guidance` /
  :meth:`compaction_guidance`: prose for the agent, for the agent once it has folded,
  and for the fold itself. Empty means "say nothing."
* **fork** -- an independent copy for branch isolation.

There is no uniform store API on the base. A KV workspace
(:class:`~...memory.InMemoryWorkspace`) exposes ``read``/``write`` for its
:class:`~...storage.StorageTool`; a custom workspace can expose whatever its tools need.
