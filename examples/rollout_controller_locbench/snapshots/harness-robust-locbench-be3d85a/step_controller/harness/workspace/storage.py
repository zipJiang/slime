"""A qwen-agent ``storage``-format tool over :class:`InMemoryWorkspace`.

qwen-agent ships a single ``storage`` tool that multiplexes ``put``/``get``/``delete``/
``scan`` over path-like keys and returns plain strings. :class:`StorageTool` mirrors it
exactly -- so the model sees the tool it was trained to use -- and executes those ops
against an :class:`InMemoryWorkspace` (passed per-call as ``workspace=`` so forks stay
isolated). Other workspace backends export their own tools; they need not speak KV.
