"""The terminal action: ending an episode by *calling* a tool, not by staying silent.

The older convention was that an assistant turn with no tool call **is** the answer.
That reads the ending off an absence, and an absence is a weak signal: a model
post-trained on tool use keeps emitting calls, so the ending it produces most naturally
is the one the convention cannot see. The failure is real -- a rollout whose
out-of-budget turn ended on a tool call scored blank, because
:meth:`~...runner.Runner.finish` does not dispatch those and there was no visible text
left to read.

:class:`SubmitTool` makes the ending a positive act. The model calls ``submit``, its
arguments *are* the answer (typed by a schema the env chooses, so a task wanting an
answer plus a citation plus a confidence asks for three fields rather than parsing them
back out of prose), and :class:`~step_controller.harness.tools.environment.ToolEnv`
intercepts the call by name before
dispatch.

The tool object here carries only a name and a schema; it is never dispatched, because
:meth:`~step_controller.harness.tools.environment.ToolEnv.step` catches it first.
:meth:`SubmitTool.call` exists so
that an env which forgot to wire it degrades to a readable message instead of "tool does
not exist".
