"""Re-scoring: recompute an action's log-probabilities under a *different* policy.

Usually the behavior policy's logprobs (captured at generation) are all that is needed.
When a later pass wants the same actions scored under another policy version -- e.g. a
frozen anchor for an importance ratio -- that is what :func:`reevaluate` is for. It only
fills :attr:`~step_controller.harness.turn.Turn.logprobs`; rewards, critics, and the env
transitions are untouched.

Scoring is per *region* but storage is per *turn*, and the two are bridged by
:attr:`~step_controller.harness.packing.PackedSequence.spans`. A region packed out of
the
log (:func:`~step_controller.harness.packing.regions`) is a self-contained token string
with a trainable mask, so re-scoring it is one teacher-forced pass -- no prefix
reconstruction -- and the returned column is then sliced back onto the turns that
produced it. Keeping the result on the turns rather than on the pack is what makes it
survive: packs are derived fresh on every call, so a logprob written to one would be
gone the next time anything asked for a region.

    Teacher-forces the sequence by generating *from* it and reading back the backend's
    ``prompt_logprobs`` (the per-token logprobs of the prompt itself). vLLM and tinker
    support this; slime/openai-chat do not (they return no prompt logprobs) and raise.
    Point one at the target policy's weights and pass it to :func:`reevaluate`.

    Never handed an empty sequence: a pack that holds no tokens is answered by
    :func:`reevaluate` itself (its columns are all ``()``), so nothing here has to
    defend against a prompt a backend would reject.

    ``timeout`` bounds one teacher-forced pass in seconds (``None``, the default, waits
    as long as the backend does) -- the re-scoring counterpart of
    ``Runner.generate_timeout``, and needed for the same reason: nothing else bounds one
    request, and :func:`~step_controller.loop.rescore_anchor` runs after the last
    search pass, with the whole prompt's exported records waiting behind it. Unlike a
    generation timeout, a fire here is **not** survivable: it comes out of
    :meth:`score` as :class:`TimeoutError` and out of ``rescore_anchor`` unchanged. The
    anchor channel is read strictly at export (an absent anchor logprob would otherwise
    read as ``exp(0) = 1`` -- "the policies agree exactly"), so a pack left unscored
    does not degrade the batch, it silently corrects nothing. Failing the run loudly is
    the honest answer; a shorter deadline is not.
