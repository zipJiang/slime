"""*When* to fold -- composable, and separate from *how*.

A :class:`Trigger` answers one question about the current checkpoint ("is it time?") and
owns the matching answer to "what has to change so it stops being time?". Those two
belong together and nowhere else: the runner front-loads the check, so a trigger that
fires but is never relieved re-fires on the very next turn and the rollout folds
forever. Keeping :meth:`Trigger.relieve` beside :meth:`Trigger.fires` is what makes that
pairing checkable in one place rather than split across a compactor's two overrides.

Splitting them out of the compactor is what lets *when* compose. Folding on a token
budget **or** a spent per-round call counter would otherwise mean a subclass welding a
state counter onto the agentic strategy by inheritance -- so an env author would have to
know which compactor they were getting, and a third condition would mean a third
subclass. :class:`AnyOf` composes instead, and the strategy stops caring.

The state a trigger reads is the *task* state, passed through untouched. That is why
:class:`StateCounter` names its fields as strings: the harness has no opinion about what
a task calls its budget, only that resetting it is what relieves the trigger.

The *prompt* it reads is the rendered token ids, as a bare sequence. The runner has that
list in hand -- it is what it is about to generate from -- and the only question asked
of it here is how long it is, which a wrapper answered no better than ``len`` does.
