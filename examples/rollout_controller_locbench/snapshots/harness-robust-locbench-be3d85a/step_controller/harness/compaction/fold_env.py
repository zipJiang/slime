"""The environment a fold runs in -- so a compaction *is* a rollout.

A fold is an agent doing a bounded piece of tool work and then saying what it kept,
which is exactly what an :class:`Env` describes -- so the ordinary
:class:`~step_controller.harness.runner.Runner` drives it, and the compactor is left
owning only its *strategy* (the instruction, the budget, the trigger). The alternative
is a second copy of the runner loop inside the compactor -- generate, parse, dispatch,
observe, finish, with its own nudge and its own budget handling -- drifting from the one
every rollout uses.

The protocol is the older, tool-free one: **a reply with no tool call ends the fold, and
its text is the context to keep.** That is deliberately not the rollout's ``submit``
convention (see the package docstring): a rollout produces an answer worth typing and
worth confirming, while a fold produces the text the agent keeps working from, so the
reply simply *is* the payload.
:class:`~step_controller.harness.tools.environment.ToolEnv` already spells that
convention ``submit=None``, so this env is one line of configuration plus three hooks.

One nudge, not a loop: the convention that ends a fold ("no tool call = done") is also
the cheapest turn to produce, so a model asked for a summary writes the whole thing in
one go -- keys and all -- having stored none of it. The first such reply is sent back
once; a fold that called *some* tool (even just reading memory) is taken at its word.
