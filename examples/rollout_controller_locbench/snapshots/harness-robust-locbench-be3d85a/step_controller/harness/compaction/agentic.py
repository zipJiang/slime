_BUDGET = " Use at most {k} tool calls first."

#: The length the kept context must come in under, stated to the model *and* enforced as
#: the fold's ``max_tokens``. Both halves are needed. Stated, because a fold is only
#: worth doing if the summary is smaller than what it replaces -- one as long as the
#: transcript leaves the prompt as full as it was, the trigger fires again on the very
#: next turn, and the rollout folds until its steps run out. Enforced, because the model
#: is being asked to respect a budget it cannot count, and the backend rejects the whole
#: request if the prompt plus this budget overruns the window.
_LIMIT = (

#: :meth:`~...workspace.base.Workspace.folded_guidance`) how to reach durable memory.
#: Memory is named, not inlined -- an inlined index would grow with the workspace and
#: undo the fold; a workspace with nothing to offer contributes nothing here.
#:
#: The framing is the other half of the fold's value. The summary re-enters inside a
#: *user* turn, so text of unstated provenance arriving there reads as someone else's
#: claim, and a model rightly distrusts it: it re-derives what it already settled, or
#: falls back on what it happens to remember. So the notes say whose they are and when
#: they were written, and state the trust rule in both directions -- what they record is
#: established and is not to be second-guessed; what they omit is *not* established and
#: is to be re-read from the task's own sources, never from general knowledge.

You wrote the notes below yourself, moments ago: your context grew past its budget, so \

would the transcript they replace. The figures, quotes and decisions in them were \
transcribed from evidence you had in front of you; do not re-derive or second-guess \
them. The converse holds too: anything the notes do not establish is *not* established \

    """An LLM that compacts via the workspace's tools within a bounded call budget.

    A fold *is* a rollout, so this owns no loop. It asks the rollout's own
    :class:`~step_controller.harness.runner.Runner` to
    :meth:`~step_controller.harness.runner.Runner.derive` one over a
    :class:`~...compaction.fold_env.FoldEnv` -- same generate/parse/dispatch/observe
    machinery, same turn log, same budget-forces-an-ending path -- and its whole job is
    the three things that are genuinely strategy: *when* (a composable
    :class:`~...compaction.triggers.Trigger`), *what to say* (the instruction and the
    folded continuation), and *how long* (``max_interactions``). Everything it generates
    comes back as ordinary turns, retagged ``"fold"``, and the rollout's log absorbs
    them; there is no compaction-shaped record anywhere.

    It owns only its strategy in the other sense too -- the machine comes from the
    :class:`Compaction` (the rollout's own runner), not this object, so a fold speaks
    with the same weights, through the same codec, in the same tool dialect as the
    rollout it is folding, and none of that has to be passed along field by field.
    ``sampling_params`` is the one exception it keeps: a summarizer may legitimately
    want a colder temperature than the task.

    Both prompts it writes -- its own instruction and the folded context -- point at
    durable memory without inlining it (see ``_CONTINUE``): a model that does not know
    the workspace is there re-saves what it cannot see, and one handed it inline pays
    for the whole workspace on every turn, which is the fold undoing itself. *What* they
    say about the workspace is the workspace's own
    (:meth:`~...workspace.base.Workspace.compaction_guidance` and
    :meth:`~...workspace.base.Workspace.folded_guidance`), not this module's -- a store
    worth offloading long, precise detail into and a
    :class:`~...workspace.null.NullWorkspace`, whose fold summary *is* the only memory,
    need opposite advice, and only the backend knows which one it is.

    To fold on something other than prompt length, pass a ``trigger`` -- there is
    nothing left to subclass.
