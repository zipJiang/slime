"""``budget``: the agentic strategy under a token-or-counter trigger.

Not a class. Folding "on the token budget *or* once the round's tool budget is spent" is
a statement about *when*, and when is a :class:`~...compaction.triggers.Trigger` now --
so this is the composition, registered under a name, rather than a subclass that welds a
state counter onto the agentic strategy by inheritance.
