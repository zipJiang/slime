"""The harness main loop: drive one rollout checkpoint to completion.

The :class:`Runner` binds the stateless pieces the harness needs -- one
:class:`~step_controller.generation.policy.Policy` (the model: its generator, its codec,
its parser) and the env it acts on -- and drives a
:class:`~step_controller.harness.rollout.RolloutState`: the complete, forkable
checkpoint of a rollout (conversation, env state, workspace, turn log), which lives in
:mod:`step_controller.harness.rollout` because a consumer of the log has no business
importing the loop. Each ``advance`` renders the messages to token ids with our own
tokenizer, generates from those ids, decodes into an assistant message, parses it into
an action, applies it in the env, appends the env's reply turns -- and records the whole
thing as one :class:`~...turn.Turn`. ``run`` loops ``advance`` until the env says done
(or a step budget is hit).

Rendering locally and sending the backend the *ids* -- never the strings -- is what
keeps the generation-side prefix identical to what a later training pass would
reconstruct from the same messages. It is also why a turn can store the exact prefix it
was conditioned on: the runner *has* that list, so nothing downstream has to reconstruct
one. It is the seam where the env's and the policy's shared action ``A`` must agree --
the runner pairs a compatible ``(policy, env)``.

**Start vs run.** :meth:`root` builds a checkpoint from an explicit seed; :meth:`start`
is the prompt-shaped front door that composes ``workspace.guidance()`` into the seed
system message first. Every continuation method -- ``advance``, ``iter_run``, ``run``,
``finish`` -- takes a :class:`~step_controller.harness.rollout.RolloutState`. A fresh
episode is ``await runner.run_from(prompt, workspace=...)``; a branch is ``await
runner.run(rs.fork())``.

**Running out of steps.** ``max_steps`` bounds a rollout, and hitting it would end one
mid-conversation with no answer -- which is the ending every caller then patches with a
"just answer now" turn of its own, outside the harness. :meth:`Runner.finish` is that
turn, in-band: the finish prompt, one generation against the same prefix, and
:meth:`Env.finish` ending the episode on it. The
checkpoint comes back ``done`` *and* ``truncated``, so the two endings stay tellable
apart. ``max_steps = -1`` is unlimited -- the loop then stops only when the env says
done (or a stride makes no progress), which also means a turn or node budget above it
bounds nothing; see :class:`~step_controller.scheduler.core.policies.Budget`.

**A backend that never answers.** ``max_steps`` bounds how many turns a rollout takes;
nothing bounds how long one of them waits. A request that hangs blocks its expansion --
and with it the whole prompt -- forever, because a scheduler stops on a *budget* and a
turn that never returns never spends any. ``generate_timeout`` is that bound, in
seconds, around each :meth:`~...generation.Policy.agenerate`: when it fires the
generation is cancelled and the turn raises :class:`TimeoutError`, which a scheduler
records as one dead expansion and re-selects the parent from -- a degraded rollout
rather than a stalled job. ``None`` (the default) or ``-1`` is the unbounded wait.

**Folding.** A runner with a :class:`Compactor` asks that compactor's ``trigger`` at
the *start* of each turn whether to fold; if it fires, that turn is the fold alone (no
task generation). :meth:`Compactor.compact` gets a :class:`Compaction` -- the grown
messages and seed, the state, the rollout's own workspace, and the runner itself -- and
returns the messages to continue from (the seed, folded to carry whatever the compactor
kept) plus whatever turns it generated getting there, which are appended to the log
tagged ``"fold"``. A compactor that generated nothing still leaves one zero-token marker
turn, so *every* fold is visible in the log as a run of fold-tagged turns and nothing
else has to be recorded about it (see :meth:`_fold`). Because the check is front-loaded,
a fold must *relieve its own trigger*, or the trigger fires again on the very next turn.
``compactor=None`` -- the default -- is a single unbounded context, and costs no
per-turn question at all.

Handing the compactor the *runner* rather than a bag of its parts is what makes
:meth:`Runner.derive` the whole of that seam: a model-driven fold is a rollout under the
same policy on a different world, so it asks for the same runner over its own env
instead of reassembling one from smuggled fields.

    Same ids, same order, same equality -- all that changes is which Python objects the
    tuple points at, and that is most of what a long rollout weighs. Every turn stores
    the exact prefix it was conditioned on and those prefixes are nested, so an N-turn
    log holds O(N x context) id slots. A re-render hands back *fresh* ``int`` objects
    each turn (a real tokenizer allocates them; only ids up to 256 are CPython's cached
    singletons), so a slot stored exactly as rendered costs a pointer **plus** a 28-byte
    int -- 36 bytes a slot, ~13 MiB for a 32-turn agentic rollout and ~160 MiB for a
    300-node tree, over 95% of everything such a log holds.

    Rebuilding the head out of the previous turn's ids leaves one pointer per slot and
    one int per *distinct* position in the final context: ~4x less, for one tuple
    compare per turn against work that just tokenized the whole conversation. The
    remaining 8 bytes a slot are inherent to storing N nested tuples -- the price of a
    turn that can name the exact ids it saw, and the figure ``docs/core-concepts.md``
    budgets a rollout by.

    The test is the packer's own (:func:`~step_controller.harness.packing.regions`): a
    prefix that extends ``previous.prefix + previous.tokens`` is the backend's cache-hit
    chain, which is the usual case and the only one worth sharing. A chat template that

        Nothing is reconstructed: a turn that had to locate its own completion inside a
        re-render is a turn whose mask can silently desync from what was generated. It
        is stored through :func:`_chained_prefix`, which changes no id and only lets the
        nested prefixes share the id *objects* they agree on.

        ``exact`` is the backend's own claim *and* the parser's: a turn whose action was
        never in its tokens is not a turn those tokens can be trained on, whatever the

        learn about parsers to avoid training on one.
