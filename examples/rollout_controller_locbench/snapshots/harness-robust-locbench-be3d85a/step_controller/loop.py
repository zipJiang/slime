    ``reward_config.anchor_version``. So the two are one name written twice, and a run
    that renames one of them alone arrives here with every edge looking off-anchor --
    which is what the error below says, rather than blaming the scorer alone.

    A mixture proposal buys coverage and owes an importance ratio on everything it drew
    off-anchor, and that ratio is
    :math:`\\exp(\\log\\pi_{\\mathrm{anchor}} - \\log\\pi_{\\mathrm{behavior}})` over

    below can: the export reads the channel strictly (an absent anchor would otherwise
    read as ``exp(0) = 1``, "the policies agree exactly"), so a missing scorer surfaces
    here as a configuration error rather than as a ``KeyError`` two layers down.

    *Every* turn is scored, folds included, because :func:`importance` measures the
    whole edge (``tags=None``): a fold's summary tokens were generated under the
    proposal like any others, and an edge missing them is not the edge the ratio is for.

    A scorer of the caller's that raises -- notably a ``TokenScorer`` whose
    ``timeout`` fired -- comes out of here unchanged, which is the honest answer rather
    than the friendly one: the export reads the anchor channel strictly, so leaving a
    pack unscored would not degrade a ratio, it would silently make it ``exp(0) = 1``.

    Nodes are walked longest turn log first so the work is not repeated: turns are
    shared objects across forked checkpoints, so a leaf's pass fills every ancestor's
    turns too, and :func:`reevaluate` then skips a region whose turns all carry the
    version. Scoring is per *region*, so a region straddling scored and unscored turns
    is still re-scored as a whole -- ``setdefault`` keeps the columns already there.
